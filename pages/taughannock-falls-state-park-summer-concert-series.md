## Taughannock Falls Concert Series History by Tony Ingraham

https://vimeo.com/439064672

Since 1979, Taughannock Falls State Park near Trumansburg, NY (10 miles north of Ithaca) has hosted a very popular summer concert series on the shore of Cayuga Lake. For the first time since then, the concert series has been canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, like so many other events around the world. In this encore episode of Walk in the Park (224) from 2019, Tony Ingraham interviews Kathleen Damiani who started the Taughannock Falls Concert Series, which originally was called the Taylor Vintage of Song for its principle sponsor, the former Taylor Wine Company. The series originally took place in a number of parks. Damiani explains this early history and the inspiration for this enduring tradition in the Finger Lakes.
