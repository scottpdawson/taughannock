There are plenty of places to cast a rod and reel at Taughannock.

In Spring, rainbow trout make a short pilgrimage up Taughannock Creek from the lake to the short waterfall visible from Route 89.

You'll also see people netting for smelt at various spots further upstream in the creek.

In winter, Taughannock Park's boat launch is one of Cayuga Lake's most accessible launch points for a boat.
