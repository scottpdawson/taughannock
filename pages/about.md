I’m [Scott Dawson](http://scottpdawson.com/). I created taughannock.us to share my love of Taughannock Falls State Park with you. The park is practically in my backyard, and I’m fortunate to be able to enjoy it year-round! I hope you find it as special as I do.

This site is in no way affiliated with Taughannock Falls State Park or any other agency, but if you do have any questions about the park, the park office is your best official resource. 

You can reach the Taughannock Falls State Park office at <a href="tel:607-387-6739">(607) 387-6739</a>.
