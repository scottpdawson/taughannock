It's so fun to take in a meal while you're at Taughannock. Picnic tables and grills are all over, scattered by the shoreline at both South and North Point. The concession stand also has covered seating if you're looking to beat the heat in the height of the summer.

Of course, you don't have to have a table to enjoy your meal. While there's no seating at the base of the waterfall, you can totally hike in, enjoy a picnic lunch sitting on one of the benches that dot the trail or on the massive landscaping rocks at the end. It's not a bad view!

Some of the best eating at the park is during summer evenings during the [concert series](/activities/taughannock-falls-state-park-summer-concert-series/). Concertgoers set up their portable tables, festive blankets, and bag chairs all over the South Point's main lawn area. They uncork their bottles of wine, share chilled beers and bring all manner of appetizers and dinner options to enjoy while listening to the music of the evening. It's a fantastic way to spend a night in upstate New York!

If you need to host a large group, you may want to rent a pavilion. There are two available pavilions at North Point and one at South Point near the marina, and it's not uncommon to see large family gatherings or weddings there. See the [park's web site](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/62/details.aspx) for more information about the pavilion application and rental process.
