I've never had occasion to camp at Taughannock, but that's only because I live really close by! No matter your camping style, Taughannock has it. There are spots for tent camping and RV camping in the main camping area just north of the main park entrance. There are also 16 cabins available clustered on the lake side of Route 89 on the north side of the park, very close to the water. While there are not many views of the lake directly from most camping spots, it is a short walk to hiking trails, the marina, the waterfront and the concession stand.

I enjoy running and hiking through parts of the campground as I make my way around Taughannock in the morning. It's very cool to see the variety of visitors that come to stay at the park, from nearby counties and faraway states. Plus, you can't beat passing by the smell of bacon cooking for breakfast when you're out for a long run!
