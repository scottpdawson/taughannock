It's been just about a year, and the bridge over Taughannock's upper falls is now open again! It's wider than the previous bridge, and has beefier steel railings along the sides. It's such a pleasure to be able to hike and run the rim trail without detouring out to Gorge Road. Since the new parking lot is still not open (soon?) the only way to access is to hike to it from the overlook to the North Rim trail, or from the South Rim trail.
