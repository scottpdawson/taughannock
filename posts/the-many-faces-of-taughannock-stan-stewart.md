My good friend [Stan Stewart](https://muz4now.com/) shares my affinity for Taughannock Falls. He writes that it's one of his favorite places to visit. Just this past week, he saw a group of people setting up for a marriage proposal at the overlook! [Check out his post about Taughannock Falls](https://muz4now.com/2018/taughannock-falls-majesty-revisited), and a link at the bottom of his page for a photo album of some of the fantastic pictures he's taken there! He also has a [fantastic post from 2017](https://muz4now.com/2017/taughannock-falls-beauty-inspiration/) showing the seasonality of the park, and the dramatic variations of water flow.
