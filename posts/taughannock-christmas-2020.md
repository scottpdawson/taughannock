Plenty of snow graced our area for the week leading up to Christmas 2020. That all changed, however, when a few inches of rain fell and temperatures rose into the low 50s. We feared flooding, but when the sun rose on Christmas Day, little flooding was evident. What was evident, though, was the power and beauty of nature as we walked the base trail.
