The leaves seem to be coming out slowly this year, which means you can still see a lot more of the gorge from the rim trail than usual. At least that's how it feels! The Black Diamond Trail also seems rather exposed since there's no rich canopy overhead to provide shade. The feature picture above is from the North Rim, looking down into the gorge and onto the base trail.

Below, you can see a unique view of the lip of Taughannock Falls from ABOVE the waterfall. Looking beyond the lip, you can also make out people standing at the end of the base trail, looking up at Taughannock Falls ([click for a super-close look](/images/IMG_0820.jpg)). Not the greatest picture I've ever taken with a phone (and everything is still a shade of brown in the gorge), but a very cool perspective, indeed.
