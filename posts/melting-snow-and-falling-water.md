Winter seemed to arrive early this year. We've had several weeks of snowfall and enjoyed a White Thanksgiving here in the Finger Lakes. The temperatures moderated over the last few days, though, and a full night of rain melted much of the snow and sent it downstream. Taughannock Creek was swollen with rainwater as I ran on the North Rim and base trails. The base of the waterfall reminded me of Niagara Falls' Maid of the Mist boat ride. I got a thorough soaking while I shot the first seconds of the clip below. I loved every minute of my morning!
