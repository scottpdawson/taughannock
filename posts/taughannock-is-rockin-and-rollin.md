A fast-moving storm dumped a ton of water on ground that really couldn’t take much more. Flood warnings are up all over the place, so I knew that Taughannock would quickly pick up its volume and give a good show. It didn’t disappoint!

The best part of the show was the upper falls, honestly. To see that volume of water cascading through such a narrow slot under the bridge is quite amazing!
