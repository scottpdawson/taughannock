Signs went up recently at the Gorge Road intersection with Black Diamond and the Jacksonville Road parking lot. Substantial improvements are coming by the end of 2025! Trail resurfacing and erosion control are welcome enhancements, as the trail can suffer from rain, snow, and rapid thaw/freeze cycles.

The new 74-spot trailhead parking lot will be accessed from Gorge Road. A path will connect directly to Black Diamond just south of its intersection with Gorge Road, and patrons can walk a short distance north to access the bridge across the north gorge of Taughannock Falls State Park, linking up with the 3-mile gorge trail.

The sign also touts a four-season restroom, welcome news for anyone who enjoys hiking, running, skiing, or snowshoeing on Black Diamond during the winter.

Trail bridge improvements are on the way, which will rehabilitate the railroad trestle bridge spanning the gorge. It currently has areas of crumbling concrete and a chain link fence. The Jacksonville Road parking lot will be allowed to return to its natural vegetated state.
