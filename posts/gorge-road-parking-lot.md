Signs went up recently at the Gorge Road intersection with Black Diamond and the Jacksonville Road parking lot. Substantial improvements are coming by the end of 2025! Trail resurfacing and erosion control are welcome enhancements, as the trail can suffer from rain, snow, and rapid thaw/freeze cycles.

The new 74-spot trailhead parking lot will be accessed from Gorge Road. A path will connect directly to Black Diamond just north of its intersection with Gorge Road, and patrons can walk a short distance to the left to access the bridge across the north gorge of Taughannock Falls State Park, linking up with the 3-mile gorge trail.

The sign also touts a four-season restroom, welcome news for anyone who enjoys hiking, running, skiing, or snowshoeing on Black Diamond during the winter.

Trail bridge improvements are on the way, which will rehabilitate the railroad trestle bridge spanning the gorge. It currently has areas of crumbling concrete and a chain link fence. The Jacksonville Road parking lot will be allowed to return to its natural vegetated state.

I spoke with Bill Hughes at Taughannock Park this morning. The Jacksonville Road parking lot is closed for a week. After that time (and since it’s a contractor, July 23 may be fungible), half of the parking lot will be available again and the other half will be used for construction staging. During this week, all access from that parking lot to BDT is closed, so reroute along Jacksonville Road and Gorge Road to get to BDT. When the lot re-opens, the access to BDT will not be along the current path, but instead along the footpath at the top of the bridge that crosses the gorge. I made a video to show what that looks like. It should be fairly clear with fencing when it is completed, too.

The Jacksonville Road parking lot is open again. The access from the parking lot to the trail is also available, though I’m not sure if they’ll be changing that, but they’ll have a short reroute when they do. The area for the new parking lot off Gorge Road is totally cleared of trees and debris, though stumps remain.
