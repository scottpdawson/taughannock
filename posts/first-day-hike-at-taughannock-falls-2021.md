Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today encouraged New Yorkers to celebrate the New Year safely by spending time outdoors this holiday season at state parks, historic sites, wildlife areas, trails, and public lands across the state beginning January 1, 2021. Families across the state are invited to participate in one of the many walks and hikes being held across the state as part of the 10th Annual First Day Hikes program, a partnership between the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and the Department of Environmental Conservation.

Taughannock's base trail is just shy of a 2-mile round trip, and the reward at the end is spectacular. To learn more, contact Taughannock Falls State Park at 607.387.7041 ext. 131
