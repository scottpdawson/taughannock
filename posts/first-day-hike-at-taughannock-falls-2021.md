Come celebrate the New Year by taking in a hike at Taughannock Falls State Park beginning January 1, 2021. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the First Day Hikes program, a partnership between the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and the Department of Environmental Conservation.

To ensure safe outdoor recreation there's no large group hike as we've had in prior years. Rather, you can do a self-guided hike or join a small group. Wear a mask or face covering (they're mandatory) and have a backup plan if the park is too full when you arrive.

Taughannock's base trail is just shy of a 2-mile round trip, and the reward at the end is spectacular. To learn more about Taughannock's plans for this event, contact the park at 607.387.7041 ext. 131.
