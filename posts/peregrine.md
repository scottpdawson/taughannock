Tim Gallagher, writing for Audubon Magazine, tells [the story of the history of Peregrine Falcons at Taughannock Park](https://www.audubon.org/news/peregrine-falcons-finally-return-nest-their-most-famous-us-eyrie). Why are they back after a 74-year absence? What's the story behind the famous 1930s photo from Arthur A. Allen of nesting Peregrine Falcons on the south gorge cliffs? And what factors might influence the return of nesting falcons in years to come?

**October 13, 2021:** Cornell's Lab of Ornithology also posted an article on their web site: [A Long-Awaited Homecoming for Peregrine Falcons in the Finger Lakes](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/a-long-awaited-homecoming-for-peregrine-falcons-in-the-finger-lakes)
