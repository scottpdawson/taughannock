The lower end of the South Rim and the stairs of the North Rim trails are open for business! Notably absent are steps at the beginning of the South Rim trail from the base parking lot. I hope those are in the works? Regardless, we don't have to grapple with deciding whether to skirt the trail closure signs in temperate days, now that the trails are fully open.
