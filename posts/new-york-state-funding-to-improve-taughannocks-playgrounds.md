From New York State's [press release](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-25-million-improve-fourteen-playgrounds-state-parks-across-new-york):

> Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced New York has committed $2.5 million to build or improve fourteen playgrounds at State Parks across New York. This funding is part of the Governor's goal to modernize 100 State Park playgrounds by 2020. ...Â State Parks will replace outdated playgrounds at parks with modern, code-compliant equipment and in distinct areas for young and older age groups. Playground improvements will be coupled with site improvements, including shade trees or canopies, seating, water fountains and trail/walkway connections to the rest of the park.

Taughannock Falls State Park is on the list! The playground at South Point is not old by many standards, so I wonder if the funding will be used to improve North Point's playground, or provide something near the marina. Regardless, it's great news for area kids and for the park.
