We received a fair amount of rain over the last 24 hours. I headed to Taughannock to get my long run in, hoping to capture a waterfall that was flowing heavier than normal. I was not disappointed!

There were a few intrepid hikers out this morning and a handful of anglers, too. In other Taughannock news, the base trail will be closed next Sunday morning (November 4) for the Pete Glavin Cross Country race. I ran the 6K course three times this morning to get my long run in for the week.

The [PGXC series](http://www.gvh.net/pete-glavin-xc-series/) brings athletes of all ages together for races throughout New York. Approximately 200 runners toe the line at each race. Runners in their late teens line up with 70 year-olds and enjoy some of the best cross country courses around. This year, we're fortunate to be able to run at Taughannock Falls State Park!

The series has already been to Stuart Park (Newark), Akron Falls County Park (near Buffalo), and Mendon Ponds Park (Rochester). The series championship will be held November 18 at the Drumlins Golf Course in Syracuse. If you're looking for a high-energy spectating opportunity, you may find it at Taughannock on November 4!
