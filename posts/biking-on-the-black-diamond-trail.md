I enjoyed a bike ride today end-to-end on the [Black Diamond Trail](/activities/hiking/). The surface is so wonderful, and rather suited to my road bike tires. The ride was very smooth, so you definitely don't need fat bike tires or a mountain bike to enjoy the ride. Wonder what the trail looks like when you're on a set of wheels? Check out the video below.
