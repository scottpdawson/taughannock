I started off my morning with a trail run out and back on the Black Diamond Trail. Starting with a warm up from the overlook parking lot gave me a chance to take in the nature around me before a good effort on flatter terrain. Upon returning, the overlook was a beautiful place to catch my breath. The sun drenched the north edge of the gorge, ducks flew through the air, and the only other sounds around me were those of my own relaxed breathing and footfalls.
