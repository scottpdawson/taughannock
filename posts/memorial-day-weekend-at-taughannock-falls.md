The weekend has barely started and there was a solid stream of cars visiting the overlook today at lunchtime. It's going to be a busy, beautiful weekend at Taughannock! There's plenty to explore, too. If crowds are not your thing, skip the overlook and head just a few minutes up the north rim trail. The view above awaits you from one of two vantage points. Make the complete rim trail circuit for three miles of beauty!
