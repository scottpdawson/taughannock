One more video, after 24 hours and a dramatic change back to winter. The water hasnâ€™t gotten the memo yet, but it will! The last half of the video is from the upper trailhead and South Rim trail. Unfortunately the base trail is closed! ([Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/scott.dawson/videos/10155926998439840/?l=5976086413291397357))
