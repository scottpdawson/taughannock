The 2018 Taughannock Summer Concert Series started last night. The weather was fantastic, the crowd smiling, and [Iron Horse's](https://www.facebook.com/ironhorseithacany/) southern rock groove was spot on. If you stuck around for their encore of Free Bird and then waited a few more minutes for darkness to descend, you also caught the great fireworks show!
