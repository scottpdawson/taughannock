I went for a much-needed walk on Taughannock's base trail Monday morning. As I walked, I considered the forecasted heat of the day, and how the remainder of the week promised to be cooler. It was a wonderful summer here in the Finger Lakes. As with many things, though, there's a finite beginning and ending.

The water falling over Taughannock's lip has slowed to a trickle. It will flow more heavily again, though. The leaves providing a rich canopy over many parts of the trail are turning colors and falling to the ground. The trees will be flush with leaves again, though. The air will turn cooler and snow will cover the trail this winter, at least for a time. It'll be hot again, though. Such is the changing of the seasons!
