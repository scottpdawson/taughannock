Start off the New Year by making a healthy resolution you will love to keep: a breath-taking hike at Taughannock Falls. Join the Finger Lakes State Parks staff for a hike down and back on the Gorge Trail! If you are up for more of a challenge you can continue up to the Overlook on the North Rim trail, across to the Multi-use trails and then make your way back to the parking lot. Plan on being outside for at least 2 hours (more if you hike all 5 miles), please dress for the weather, bring water and wear appropriate footwear. We will meet at the start of the Gorge Trail by NYS Route 89.
