Today's temperatures started in the low teens, so perfect for a trail run, right? The first mile was brutal, but the brutality lessened as I came into the cover of the woods and the gorge. I stood for a moment on the pedestrian bridge at the end of the base trail, taking in the quiet beauty of the gorge around me. Next time you're there, look closely at the overhanging gorge walls. The rock clinging tenuously to the walls. The icicles slowly descending from their frosty perches. The gorge is slowly but constantly changing, and it is gorgeous.
