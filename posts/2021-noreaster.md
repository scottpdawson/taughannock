October 26 brought heavy rain to upstate New York. In the early evening, the Tompkins County Sheriff's Office issued a travel advisory as flooding continued on roadways throughout Tompkins County. Local waterfalls were impressive at the height of the storm, and Taughannock was no exception. The first half of this features day-of-storm video shot by my daughter Elizabeth. Second half are just after dawn during my morning run. Fantastic!
