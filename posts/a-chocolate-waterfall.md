Everything turns lush and green when it rains in the Finger Lakes. When it [rains too much](https://ithacavoice.com/2018/08/weather-flash-flooding-risk-through-tonight/), however, a touch of brown is added to that greenery. Well, "a touch" is a bit too subtle. When Taughannock flows heavily amid weather service warnings of localized flooding, I'm reminded of Willy Wonka's chocolate waterfall. A very, very powerful chocolate waterfall.

If you saw Taughannock at its driest this year in early summer, you'll be shocked at the amazing photos and videos that my friend Laura captured at the park this morning. She and her husband Scott are also frequent runners in the park and I'm so grateful they shared these amazing views!
