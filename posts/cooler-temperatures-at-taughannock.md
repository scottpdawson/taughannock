Yesterday's cold front took summertime temperatures away from the Finger Lakes region, at least for the foreseeable future! The cooler temperatures this morning provided the perfect crisp backdrop for a leisurely walk around the rim trail.

Looking toward the lake from the north rim, you can almost imaging the vibrant colors that'll soon be out in full force. The yellows and oranges are starting to pop through the canopies, overlooking a fully and happy Taughannock Creek.

I enjoyed seeing people fishing just beyond the Route 89 bridge, too. It must be a fantastic time of year for fish to explore upstream from the junction with Cayuga Lake.
