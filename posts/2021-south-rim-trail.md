The constantly evolving seasons make for a unique rim trail hike no matter the time of year. When the trees are still mostly bare and buds are barely forming on their branches, views like this open up all over the park. This photo is taken from one of the few gorge vantage points on the South Rim Trail. You'll know them by following the fence line. At two spots below the junction with Gorge Road, the fence line juts out to an angle, pointing toward the precipice of the gorge. Small footpaths invite hikers to walk the few paces to the viewing points, which provide a unique perspective when trees are mostly bare. Like today.
