It's icy and cold in the Finger Lakes again (starting to look like the prior season's picture above), which means it's time for the park to close sections of the North and South Rim Trail. Specifically, the south segment from the base parking lot to the junction with Gorge Road, and the north segment's bottom staircase. The stairs to the lower part of the overlook are closed, too.

If you're a rim trail hiker, use the road on the bottom half of the south side, and the alternate route signs on the north side will take you on the campground access road to circumvent the stairs.

Happy winter hiking!
