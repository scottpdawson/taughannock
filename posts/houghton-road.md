The Finger Lakes Land Trust (FLLT) purchased 23 acres from the Cayuga Nature Center. The Black Diamond Trail passes through the property at the Houghton Road crossing. The trust plans to transfer the land to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation (OPRHP), which owns and manages the Black Diamond Trail. OHRHP noted their interest in creating a mid-point area with parking, restrooms, and water, similar to the project underway at Taughannock's Gorge Road intersection.
