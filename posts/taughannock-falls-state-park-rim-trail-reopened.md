For those of you who love to hike at Taughannock, my wife and daughter (who've been on a hike streak for the past few weeks) told me that the lower South Rim trail and stairs on the North Rim trail are OPEN! This means no more hitting the road if you don't want to skirt the rules.

Also timely, I'm so grateful that the parks in the Ithaca area are open. The state provides such a valuable place for us to be, especially during this time. Nature can be a wonderful salve, indeed. If you do head out to hike, please don't bunch up on the trails. It would be a tragedy to have the state unilaterally close the parks if we don't [practice proper social distancing](https://twitter.com/NYstateparks/status/1241323903970152448).
