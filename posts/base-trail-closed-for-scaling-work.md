I ran into Fred Bonn this morning at the overlook. He told me that the base trail would be closed today, and potentially part of tomorrow, for scaling work.

Sure enough, as I made my way around the South Rim, I saw the Finger Lakes Region Scaling Team arriving and setting up halfway down the south side. They were all smiles: I think they LOVE their job! They get to harness up and scale the cliffs in some of the most beautiful places in New York State.

Check out this video of the team at work at Watkins Glen State Park, and also a great post at [ithacafingerlakes.com](http://ithacafingerlakes.com/2012/04/07/scaling-those-cliffs/).
