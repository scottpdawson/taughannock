We might get some respite from multiple days of rain tomorrow. In the meantime, the area feels like a rainforest and Taughannock Falls is fully alive! There's plenty of water in the stream and massive humidity in the air. I took this video from the overlook this morning, and love seeing clouds hanging on in the middle of the gorge.
