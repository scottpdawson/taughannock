The background image was taken several years ago from the bridge at the top of Taughannock Falls State Park. I thought it looked like a great example of when eroded shale left sturdier Sherburne sandstone above unsupported and vulnerable to breaking and falling. But when would the substantial overhang of stone finally break free?

Well, this morning, I got my answer. It was very recent, likely within the last day or so. Here's how it looked during my run this morning.

Zooming in, you can see the large void where rock once perched.

All of that rock must have made a spectacular sound as it crashed to the gorge floor. I wonder if anyone was around to see or hear it in the last few days?
