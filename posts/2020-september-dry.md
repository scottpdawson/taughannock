Well, that's easy. When there's no water! We're not _quite_ there yet, but we're close. I was excited to plan a morning run on the base trail and around South Point. During my warmup, I brought my phone to the end of the base trail to capture the incredibly dry waterfall and creek bed. It was so dry that I was able to run (without rock-hopping, mind you) in the creek bed away from the waterfall to capture some of these photos.

The park has been lovely on these cooler mornings, but with so little precipitation in what feels like _forever_, the park eerily lacks the sounds of falling and flowing water.
