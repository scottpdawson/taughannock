Next Saturday, July 14, the Finger Lakes International Dragon Boat Festival comes to Taughannock Falls State Park! The event is from 8a-5:30p. If you've never seen dragon boat racing, this is a fantastic opportunity to see it at the park!

> Traditionally, the Dragon Boat Festival is known as Duan Wu Jie (Mandarin) or Tuen Ng (Cantonese) which translates almost literary "Day of Right mid-Day". It also known as Double Fifth Celebration, the Festival is traditionally celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month in the lunar calendar. Because of the modernization and the popularity of dragon boating, the Festival is becoming known as the Dragon Boat Festival. [fingerlakesdragonboat.org](http://fingerlakesdragonboat.org)
